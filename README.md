This is the very beginning of our group projects with ALX

This project is the mimic of the C printf function and the project was done in pairs of two

it start with being able to manipulate any format
We used the function pointers and also variadic functions to ensure that our desired output is achieved
int _printf(const char *format, ...)
{
        this was our printf format.
        the function took an infinity number of arguments
        @format being the character string
}

We then handled the decimal and integer conversion but without handling the precision and flag characters

we handled the case when the printf receives request for binary format
